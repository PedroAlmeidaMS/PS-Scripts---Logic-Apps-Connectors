# PowerShellScripts
Bundle of PS scripts to help the community.

#Version 1
This is a repo that will serve as container to the scripts I created in order to help the community.

All scripts are public and provided AS-IS, there's no warranty to them.

Feel free to join in and improve them, if I can learn something new, it's great.
